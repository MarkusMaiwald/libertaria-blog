<p><em>An Essay for Libertaria Chapter Members</em></p>
<p><em>Adapted from the Lecture of Professor Jiang, Beijing, January 2026</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You were never choosing between systems. You were choosing which mask your masters would wear.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-incision-a-seamless-transition">The Incision: A Seamless Transition</h2>
<p>China transitioned from Communism to Capitalism like a snake shedding its skin.</p>
<p>No civil war. No ideological spasms. No mass purges of the Party faithful. One day the Cultural Revolution was destroying temples; the next, Shenzhen was building factories for Western capital. The transition was; by historical standards; <em>eerily</em> smooth.</p>
<p>This should trouble you.</p>
<p>When Europe moved from feudalism to capitalism, millions died in the Thirty Years’ War, the Napoleonic campaigns, and countless peasant revolts. When Protestant Christianity split from Catholic Europe, a quarter of Germany was exterminated. Ideological transitions, historically speaking, are bathed in blood.</p>
<p>Yet Communist China became Capitalist China with the grace of a corporate rebrand.</p>
<p><strong>Professor Jiang, teaching in a Beijing high school what no European university would dare say aloud, asked the question that collapses the Cold War narrative:</strong></p>
<p><em>If capitalism and communism are polar opposites; a true dialectic; then how did China switch between them without friction?</em></p>
<p>The answer is simple and devastating: <strong>the dialectic was false.</strong></p>
<p>Capitalism and Communism were never enemies. They were partners.</p>
<h2 id="the-autopsy-naming-the-real-enemies">The Autopsy: Naming the Real Enemies</h2>
<p>Professor Jiang’s framework cuts through a century of propaganda. To understand the conspiracy, you must first understand what capital <em>actually</em> fears.</p>
<h3 id="the-four-horsemen-of-capitals-apocalypse">The Four Horsemen of Capital’s Apocalypse</h3>
<p><strong>1. Monarchy</strong></p>
<p>The king cancels debts. The king redistributes land. The king derives legitimacy from lineage, tradition, and divine right; not from the accumulation of capital. A good king is popular precisely because he constraints extraction.</p>
<p>Capital cannot tolerate kings.</p>
<p><strong>2. Theocracy</strong></p>
<p>Every major religion teaches that money is corrosive. God wants you to love your children, serve your community, and pursue salvation; not quarterly returns. In Catholic Europe, usury was a sin. Merchants were tolerated, not celebrated.</p>
<p>Capital cannot tolerate priests.</p>
<p><strong>3. Nationalism</strong></p>
<p>Nationalism demands loyalty to your <em>people</em>; a barrier to the free flow of capital across borders. If I am loyal to my nation, I cannot invest in her enemies. Nationalism creates friction, and capital requires frictionless movement.</p>
<p>Capital cannot tolerate patriots.</p>
<p><strong>4. Democracy (Actual, Not Theatrical)</strong></p>
<p>If workers could actually vote their interests, they would redistribute wealth. They would tax the rich. They would cap extraction. They would build welfare states that protect labor.</p>
<p>Capital cannot tolerate <em>real</em> democracy.</p>
<h3 id="the-paradox-dissolves">The Paradox Dissolves</h3>
<p>Now observe what Communism <em>does</em> to each of these enemies:</p>

























<table><thead><tr><th>Threat to Capital</th><th>Communist Solution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Monarchy</strong></td><td>Destroyed. Replace kings with <em>Party</em>; an oligarchy by another name.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Theocracy</strong></td><td>Destroyed. “Religion is the opiate of the masses.” Bulldoze the churches.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationalism</strong></td><td>Destroyed. “Workers of the world, unite!” Class consciousness replaces national identity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Democracy</strong></td><td>Destroyed. Workers have “false consciousness”; a <em>vanguard party</em> must lead them.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><strong>Communism is not the antithesis of capitalism. It is the virus capitalism deploys to destroy its actual enemies.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-genealogy-tracing-the-bloodline">The Genealogy: Tracing the Bloodline</h2>
<h3 id="the-anomaly-of-karl-marx">The Anomaly of Karl Marx</h3>
<p>Karl Marx was a German exile who spent his career in <em>Britain</em>; the most capitalist nation on Earth in the 19th century. The British authorities let him work freely in the British Museum. His wife was German aristocracy. His patron, Friedrich Engels, was the son of a wealthy industrialist.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why would Britain; the beating heart of global capitalism; harbor a man calling for the destruction of capitalists?</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Why would a capitalist industrialist fund a movement calling for the abolition of private property?</p>
<p>These are not conspiracy theories. These are historical facts that demand explanation.</p>
<p>Professor Jiang’s framework provides one: <strong>Marx was useful precisely because he radicalized the socialist movement into incoherence.</strong></p>
<h3 id="socialism-vs-communism-a-critical-distinction">Socialism vs. Communism: A Critical Distinction</h3>
<p>This is where most observers make a fatal error. They conflate socialism with communism. They are <em>not the same thing.</em></p>
<p><strong>Socialism</strong> is redistribution.</p>
<p>Take from the rich, give to the poor. The middle class gains power and status as wealth is leveled. This is a <em>stable coalition</em>: workers and the middle class united against oligarchy. It emerges naturally from industrialization. It is what Europe became after World War II; welfare states, strong unions, social safety nets.</p>
<p><strong>Communism</strong> is abolition.</p>
<p>No property. No inheritance. No classes. Everyone is equal; which means everyone except the Party is equally powerless.</p>
<p>The difference is not semantic. It is strategic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Socialism unites the poor <em>and</em> the middle class against the oligarchy.</li>
<li>Communism <em>destroys</em> the middle class, forcing them to ally with the oligarchy for survival.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marx did not refine socialism. <strong>He mutilated it.</strong></p>
<p>By demanding total equality, vanguard parties, and international revolution, Marx transformed a naturally emerging movement into something so extreme that it could be used as a <em>scaregoat</em>. Anyone calling for modest redistribution could now be painted as a secret communist bent on world domination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Communist Manifesto was not a blueprint for liberation. It was a psy-op to delegitimize social democracy.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-evidence-following-the-money">The Evidence: Following the Money</h2>
<h3 id="1848-the-elites-get-scared">1848: The Elites Get Scared</h3>
<p>The 1848 Revolutions erupted across Europe. In France, Germany, Austria, Italy; everywhere; the bourgeoisie, middle class, and workers rose together against the old order. They demanded democracy, liberalism, and social reform.</p>
<p>The monarchies were terrified. The Concert of Europe; their gentleman’s agreement to maintain the status quo; was crumbling.</p>
<p>Their response? <strong>Divide the coalition.</strong></p>
<p>The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848. Its timing is not coincidental.</p>
<p>By reframing the conflict as <em>class war</em>; bourgeoisie against proletariat; communism shattered the alliance that threatened the old order. Now the middle class had to fear the workers. Now the workers could be painted as tools of an international conspiracy.</p>
<h3 id="1917-wall-street-backs-the-bolsheviks">1917: Wall Street Backs the Bolsheviks</h3>
<p>The Russian Revolution is sold to us as a proletarian uprising against capitalism. The historical record tells a different story.</p>
<p>Professor Jiang, drawing on Richard Spence’s <em>Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution</em>, documents the financial flows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bolsheviks paid mercenaries; Latvians, Chinese, Hungarians; over 200,000 foreign soldiers. <strong>Where did a broke revolutionary party get that money?</strong></li>
<li>The Romanov fortune; billions in foreign banks; was seized when the entire family was murdered. <strong>Those billions stayed in London and New York.</strong></li>
<li>Allied armies entered Russia during the Civil War. They did not crush the Bolsheviks. <strong>They collected debts.</strong> Then they attacked the <em>Whites</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wall Street wanted Russia destroyed as a competitor. It wanted the Romanov fortune. It wanted to asset-strip an empire. The Bolsheviks delivered on all counts.</p>
<h3 id="the-red-terror-asset-stripping-as-revolution">The Red Terror: Asset-Stripping as Revolution</h3>
<p>The Bolsheviks implemented what economists would later call “shock therapy.” They confiscated everything: palaces, churches, museums, jewelry, private wealth. By 1921, over $450 million in valuables had been extracted and sold abroad; “fenced for a fraction of its value in capitalist hard currency.”</p>
<p>The Red Terror was not ideological purification. <strong>It was liquidation.</strong></p>
<p>And when the Soviet Union finally collapsed in 1991? Russia became “capitalist” overnight. The oligarchs who emerged were simply the new management of the same extraction engine.</p>
<h2 id="the-taxonomy-of--isms-a-field-guide-for-the-trapped">The Taxonomy of -Isms: A Field Guide for the Trapped</h2>
<p>Every -ism is a trap. Understanding the trap does not free you; but it lets you stop stepping on the same landmines.</p>















































<table><thead><tr><th>Ism</th><th>Core Promise</th><th>Why It Fails</th><th>Who Benefits</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Socialism</strong></td><td>Shared burdens, collective lift</td><td>Envy scales; incentives collapse without property rights</td><td>Middle class (until capture)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Communism</strong></td><td>Classless paradise</td><td>Requires vanguard party that never relinquishes power</td><td>The Party (oligarchy renamed)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Capitalism</strong></td><td>Self-interest builds abundance</td><td>Consolidates into oligopoly; buys the state</td><td>Oligarchs (until revolution)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationalism</strong></td><td>Loyalty to your people</td><td>Weaponized for war; captured by demagogues</td><td>Military-industrial complex</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Democracy</strong></td><td>Rule by the people</td><td>Voters manipulated; lobbies capture policy</td><td>Media and donor class</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Anarchism</strong></td><td>Pure freedom</td><td>Strongest form warlords; enforcement vacuum</td><td>The first gang to organize</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><strong>The pattern is invariant:</strong> every -ism promises liberation and delivers a new master.</p>
<p>The question is not “which -ism is correct?” The question is: <strong>why do we keep playing this game?</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-trap-why-movements-betray-you">The Trap: Why Movements Betray You</h2>
<p>Here is the uncomfortable truth Professor Jiang circles but we must state directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Being part of a movement means being played.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Movements require <em>coordination</em>. Coordination requires <em>leadership</em>. Leadership requires <em>resources</em>. Resources require <em>backers</em>. Backers have <em>interests</em>.</p>
<p>By the time a movement is large enough to matter, it has been captured.</p>
<p>The socialists of 1848 wanted modest reform. Their movement was captured and radicalized into communism; which scared the middle class into alliance with the oligarchy.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks thought they were liberating the workers. They were liquidating Russian wealth for Western banks.</p>
<p>The nationalists thought they were defending their people. They were providing cannon fodder for industrial-era wars that concentrated power in military states.</p>
<p><strong>The -ism is the bait. The movement is the trap. The capture is the outcome.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-exit-what-libertaria-offers">The Exit: What Libertaria Offers</h2>
<p>There is only one escape from the game of -isms: <strong>refuse to play.</strong></p>
<p>This is the Libertaria thesis, and it is why Professor Jiang’s lecture matters to us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You cannot design governance that resists capture. You can only design <em>exit</em> that makes capture irrelevant.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-old-model-voice">The Old Model: Voice</h3>
<p>Every -ism assumes you must <em>persuade</em> the system. Vote. Protest. Organize. Petition. Reform. Revolt.</p>
<p>All of these are <em>voice</em>. And voice can be co-opted.</p>
<p>Your vote can be manipulated. Your protest can be ignored. Your organization can be infiltrated. Your petition can be filed. Your reform can be rolled back. Your revolt can be redirected.</p>
<p><strong>Voice is a game where the house always wins.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-new-model-exit">The New Model: Exit</h3>
<p>Libertaria inverts the architecture. We do not try to capture governance. We make governance compete for <em>us</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ChapterPassport:</strong> Your reputation, contributions, and endorsements are portable. When a Chapter is captured, you leave; and you take your social capital with you.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol-Level Exit:</strong> Exit is not a negotiated permission. It is a cryptographic guarantee. The constitution cannot be silently changed. The rules are anchored to Bitcoin.</li>
<li><strong>Governance Pluralism:</strong> Chapters experiment with different models. Some will fail. Some will be captured. The network learns by observing which Chapters people <em>leave</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The false dialectic of capitalism versus communism persists because people cannot escape. They are rooted like plants; their only option is to scream into the wind.</p>
<p><strong>We are not plants. We are architects of our own exit.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-warning-history-does-not-end">The Warning: History Does Not End</h2>
<p>Professor Jiang’s lecture is not an academic exercise. It is a diagnostic.</p>
<p>The same forces that funded Marx, financed the Bolsheviks, and asset-stripped Russia are still operational. They do not care about your -ism. They care about extraction. They will fund any movement that advances their interests and destroy any movement that threatens them.</p>
<p>If you join a movement; any movement; ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is funding this?</li>
<li>What happens to the middle class?</li>
<li>Does this unite or divide potential allies?</li>
<li>Where is the exit?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you cannot answer these questions, you are the product, not the participant.</p>
<h2 id="coda-the-real-lesson-of-china">Coda: The Real Lesson of China</h2>
<p>China transitioned from communism to capitalism without upheaval because the transition was <em>lateral, not vertical</em>. The Party remained. The extraction continued. Only the ideological packaging changed.</p>
<p>The workers in Foxconn factories are not freer than the workers in Mao’s communes. They are simply being exploited under a different flag.</p>
<p>This is what the false dialectic conceals: <strong>capitalism and communism are two operating systems for the same machine.</strong></p>
<p>The machine extracts. The machine consolidates. The machine captures.</p>
<p>The only question is whether you are inside the machine or outside it.</p>
<p><strong>Libertaria offers the outside.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We do not build the good society. We build the substrate where societies compete. We do not capture the state. We make the state irrelevant. We do not pick an -ism. We architect the exit.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>History is fascinating because it reveals the mechanics of our enslavement. But fascination is not freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom is the door you can actually walk through.</strong></p>
<p>Build the door.</p>
