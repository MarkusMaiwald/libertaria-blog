# The Federation Axioms: The Physics of Sovereign Coexistence

> **Axioms are the smallest set of self-evident truths that require no justification, from which everything else can be derived.**

---

## Why Axioms?

*Commandments* reeks of Sinai and submission. *Basic Law* reeks of occupation and surrender of sovereignty. *Laws* implies a legislator with a monopoly on violence.

We call them **Federation Axioms**.

Axioms are mathematical. Not theological. Not legal. They imply *minimalism*: you need exactly as many as necessary and not one more.

> **The Federation Axioms are not laws. They are the physics of the system.**

Whoever breaks them does not break a rule; they break compatibility with the protocol.

## The Architecture

```
FEDERATION AXIOMS (Universal Ethics)
        ↓ constrains
CHAPTER GENESIS (Local Morality → Local Law)
        ↓ constrains
CHAPTER POLICY (Operational Rules)
        ↓ governs
CITIZEN BEHAVIOR
```

> **A Chapter may be arbitrarily strict; but never less protective than the Axioms demand.**

Vienna may decide that weapons are forbidden. Hanoi may decide that weapons are mandatory. Both are locally legal. But neither Vienna nor Hanoi may decide that exit is forbidden, that children have no emancipation, or that collective punishment is allowed.

The Axioms are the **floor**, not the **ceiling**.

---

## Axiom 0: The Right to Exit

> **No Chapter may prevent, delay, penalize, or disincentivize the departure of any sovereign agent.**

This is not Axiom 1. It is Axiom *Zero* — the prerequisite for all others. Without exit, all other rights are decoration.

*Mechanism:* SoulKey portability, ChapterPassport, reputation snapshot at departure. Cryptographically enforced; no Chapter can delete the SoulKey or corrupt the reputation.

---

## Axiom I: The Right to Be Left Alone

> **No sovereign agent shall be compelled to interact, associate, transact, or communicate against their expressed will.**

This covers: spam, forced membership in guilds, forced participation in governance, conscription of any kind. A sovereign may be silent. A sovereign may refuse.

*Mechanism:* Membrane Agent (L1), Entropy Stamps, Trust Topology. The airlock model enforces consent at the protocol level.

**The mirror:** If you have the right to be left alone, so does everyone else. No Chapter may force its members to interact with non-members. Sovereignty cuts both ways.

---

## Axiom II: The Inviolability of Expression

> **No Chapter may punish, restrict, or penalize any sovereign agent for the expression of opinion, belief, analysis, or creative work within Federation communication channels.**

*Critical distinction:* This protects **expression**, not **action**. A Chapter may regulate actions that follow from opinions. But the opinion itself — in text, speech, art, code — is inviolable at the Federation level.

*Mechanism:* Content Manifest (RFC-0290) generates cryptographic proof of authorship. If a Chapter punishes expression, it is visible in the Attestation-Log; and other Chapters can use this information to evaluate Federation status.

**The blade:** A Chapter *may* internally decide that certain expression is unwelcome within *their* channels. Local morality. But they may not **punish** the sovereign for expressing that opinion at the Federation level. The difference between *"we don't want to hear that here"* and *"you will be punished for saying that."*

---

## Axiom III: Sovereignty of the Body

> **No Chapter may claim jurisdiction over a sovereign agent's physical body. No forced labor. No forced medical intervention. No physical coercion. No detention without active dispute proceedings.**

This is missing in almost all digital governance projects because they pretend the human is purely digital. They are not. The body is the final property. No protocol can protect it if it is in a jurisdiction that does not respect it; but the Axiom makes compliance *measurable* and non-compliance *visible*.

*Mechanism:* Status Primitive + Bond Primitive. Any Chapter taking physical measures against members must legitimize it through the dispute process. Arbitrary detention without active dispute proceedings = automatic Federation flag.

---

## Axiom IV: Larval Sovereignty

> **Every dependent being within a Chapter must have a cryptographically guaranteed path to full sovereignty. No Chapter may design a system where dependents remain permanently dependent.**

Children. Disabled persons in care. Anyone under custodial arrangement. The Hard Fork Escape Hatch exists in the protocol; this elevates it to an Axiom.

*Mechanism:* LarvalKey → Emancipation Test → SoulKey path (RFC-0250). Every LarvalKey *must* have an emancipation condition. A Chapter issuing LarvalKeys without an emancipation path violates Federation compatibility.

**Why this must be an Axiom:** Without it, a Chapter could build a caste system where certain people *never* achieve sovereignty. This is the mechanism of every historical slavery.

---

## Axiom V: Reputation Integrity

> **No entity — neither Chapter, nor agent, nor Federation itself — may forge, erase, corrupt, or selectively withhold the reputation record of any sovereign agent.**

Your reputation is your portable capital. If a Chapter can corrupt your reputation upon exit, then exit is a punishment rather than a right. If a Chapter can inflate your reputation, that is a Sybil attack on the Federation level.

*Mechanism:* Cryptographically signed reputation snapshots, Bitcoin-anchoring of the Attestation-Log. Tamper-proof by design. ChapterPassport as immutable record.

---

## Axiom VI: The Right to Opacity

> **No Chapter may compel disclosure of identity, belief, association, transaction history, or personal data beyond what the sovereign agent explicitly consented to at the point of entry.**

*Privacy* is not a feature. It is an Axiom. If a Chapter changes consent conditions after joining and demands *more* data, the sovereign has the right to refuse without consequences (because exit is already guaranteed by Axiom 0).

*Mechanism:* JanusIdentity (RFC-0260), ZK-Proofs for selective disclosure. Consent conditions are part of the ChapterGenesis and thus Bitcoin-anchored; subsequent changes are visible.

---

## Axiom VII: Prohibition of Collective Punishment

> **No Chapter may penalize a sovereign agent for the actions, beliefs, or affiliations of another agent, group, Chapter, or any collective to which the agent belongs or belonged.**

*Sippenhaft* is the oldest control mechanism of civilization. You hold a population in check by punishing the family when one rebels. This must be forbidden at the Axiom level.

*Mechanism:* Status Primitive may only respond to individual attestations. No status change without individual dispute proceedings. If a Chapter executes a blanket status slash on all members of a group, that is a Federation flag.

---

## Axiom VIII: The Right to Defense

> **Every sovereign agent accused in any Dispute proceeding has the right to be informed of the accusation, to present evidence, and to access the Dispute Primitive before any Status change takes effect.**

No *Kafkaesque* proceedings. You cannot be punished without knowing what for and without the opportunity to defend yourself *before* consequences apply.

*Mechanism:* Dispute Primitive (RFC-0280) enforces a notification phase before status changes. The sovereign *must* be informed. The sovereign *must* get a response window.

---

## Axiom IX: Voluntary Association

> **All association within the Federation is voluntary. No agent may be enrolled, conscripted, or bound to any Chapter, Guild, or collective without their active, informed, and revocable consent.**

This sounds redundant with Axiom 0 (Exit) and Axiom I (Left Alone). But it covers a different vector: **Entry**. Exit protects you from having to stay. Voluntary Association protects you from having to join.

*Mechanism:* Gateway Protocol (RFC-0260) requires active consent signature. No automatic membership. No "you are a member because you were born here" — the mechanism nation-states use.

---

## Axiom X: The Sanctity of Agreement

> **Voluntary agreements between sovereign agents shall be honored as entered. No Chapter may retroactively void, alter, or reinterpret a bilateral agreement to which it was not a party.**

This is the *Contract* Axiom. Without it, a Chapter could void contracts between sovereigns "in the public interest" — exactly what states do. *Pacta sunt servanda* — but only for *voluntary* agreements (Axiom IX secures that the voluntariness is real).

*Mechanism:* Escrow Primitive (RFC-0280) anchors agreements. Bitcoin-timestamp makes subsequent manipulation visible.

---

## The Enforcement Question

Here it gets interesting — and here Libertaria separates from every utopia that came before.

*Who enforces the Axioms when there is no central authority?*

The answer: **Nobody. And everybody.**

A Chapter that violates an Axiom does not cease to exist. It loses **Federation compatibility**. Other Chapters see the violation (because everything is attested and anchored). Other Chapters individually decide whether to continue federating.

This is *not* enforcement through violence. This is enforcement through **reputation and exit dynamics.**

A Chapter that violates Axiom IV (Larval Sovereignty) and imprisons children will be recognized as toxic by other Chapters. Members leave. New members do not join. The Chapter dies — not through judgment, but through *selection*.

> **The Axioms are not enforced by a judge. They are enforced by the physics of the protocol and the market pressure of the Federation.**

---

## What is Missing?

Three candidates I consciously *did not* include, and why:

**"Right to Property"** — Too controversial between Chapters. What property *is* differs radically between a Bitcoin-Fortress Chapter and a Commons-collective. Local morality; not Federation ethics.

**"Right to Life"** — Sounds obvious. But: How do you define it for AI agents? For Larval identities not yet emancipated? Sovereignty-of-Body (Axiom III) covers physical protection. "Life" as an abstract right leads to philosophical dead-ends that should be solved at the Chapter level.

**"Right to Equal Treatment"** — Chapters *may* discriminate in admission. That is their sovereignty. What they may not do: prevent exit, punish expression, imprison children, punish collectively. *Equal treatment* is local morality; the Axioms protect the *flight* from unequal treatment rather than prohibiting unequal treatment.

---

## The Forge is Clean

Ten Axioms plus one Null-Axiom. Minimal enough not to fall into UN-human-rights-catalog absurdity. Strong enough to cover every historical form of oppression.

These are not requests. These are not ideals. These are **the physics of sovereign coexistence**.

A Chapter may build any paradise or nightmare it wishes — within these boundaries. The Federation does not judge morality. The Federation ensures **exit**.

And in a world with guaranteed exit, only the worthiest Chapters survive.

*First published March 15, 2020. The Federation Axioms represent the ethical foundation of the Libertaria project — the unnegotiable floor beneath which no Chapter may sink, and the physics from which all local law derives.*
