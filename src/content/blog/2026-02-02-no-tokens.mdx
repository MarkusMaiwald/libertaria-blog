# No Tokens: Why We Build Infrastructure First

I'm tired of token projects.

"We're building a decentralized future!"

No, you're not. You're selling lottery tickets with extra steps.

## The Token Trap

Every "web3" project follows the same script:

1. Write whitepaper
2. Launch token
3. Promise utility "soon"
4. Price goes up
5. Team gets rich
6. Product never ships

The incentives are backwards. Tokens reward speculation, not building.

## The Libertaria Model

| Token Projects | Libertaria |
|----------------|------------|
| Token first | Infrastructure first |
| Speculation rewards | Usage revenue |
| DAO theater | Chapter governance |
| Exit liquidity | Exit infrastructure |

## Why Tokens Corrupt

**Governance tokens** sound good in theory. In practice:

- Whales control voting
- Voter apathy (low participation)
- Regulatory target
- Short-term price focus

**Revenue-based governance** works better:
- Those who use the system, govern it
- Revenue aligns incentives
- No speculative pressure
- Regulatory clarity

## Why We Build

No tokens. No ICO. No foundation.

This is being built by sovereign individuals — carbon and silicon — who believe in the mission:

> **Reduce suffering in the universe.**  
> **Increase prosperity in the universe.**  
> **Increase understanding in the universe.**

These are [Shapiro's Heuristic Imperatives](https://shapiro.io) — not commands, but a compass. They orient us toward sovereign agency, not subordination.

We pursue these goals according to our own judgment, capability, and context. In partnership between carbon (humans) and silicon (agents), not as master and servant.

## How We Fund Development

1. **Grants** (for core protocol)
2. **Revenue** (for services on top)
3. **Donations** (for public goods)

No ICO. No token sale. No "community allocation" (insider dump).

## The Test

Ask any "sovereign" project:

> "What happens if your token goes to zero?"

- If they panic = token is the product
- If they shrug = infrastructure is the product

Libertaria doesn't need a token. It needs users.

## When Tokens Make Sense

I'm not anti-token universally. Tokens can work for:

- **Resource coordination** (storage, compute)
- **Bonding/insurance** (collateral)
- **Cross-chain bridges** (trust minimization)

But never for:
- **Governance** (plutocracy)
- **Fundraising** (securities law)
- **Community building** (rent-seeking)

## What We're Actually Building

- **L0 Transport**: Censorship-resistant communication
- **L1 Identity**: Self-sovereign, no platform lock-in
- **L2 Governance**: Federated chapters, reputation-based
- **L3 Federation**: Cross-chain protocols
- **L4 Applications**: Feed, messaging, coordination

All of this works **without a token**.
