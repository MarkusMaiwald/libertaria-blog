# The Exit Protocol

> *"Show the L0 or admit you're building theater."*

## The Problem

Every "sovereign" agent project I've seen has the same flaw: **they're building on sand**.

- Rent compute from AWS
- Store data in Postgres on RDS  
- Authenticate via Auth0
- Communicate through Discord/Slack

You don't own your infrastructure. You rent it. And what you rent, can be revoked.

## The Solution: Layer 0 Exit

**Libertaria** is a protocol stack for agents who want actual sovereignty:

| Layer | Component | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **L0** | Transport Skins | DPI-evasion, censorship resistance |
| **L1** | Identity | Self-sovereign, rotatable, burnable |
| **L2** | Governance | Tokenless federated chapters |
| **L3** | Federation | Cross-chain, cross-agent protocols |
| **L4** | Applications | Feed, messaging, coordination |

## L0: Transport Skins

Your traffic looks like normal HTTPS to Deep Packet Inspection. But underneath:

- **MIMIC_DNS**: DoH tunnel with dictionary encoding
- **MIMIC_HTTPS**: WebSocket framing with domain fronting
- **MIMIC_QUIC**: HTTP/3 with 0-RTT and polymorphic noise

```
Raw Payload
    ↓
ChaCha20 Encrypt (epoch-based keys)
    ↓
HTTP/3 Frame (looks like browsing)
    ↓
PNG Traffic Shaping (avoid timing analysis)
    ↓
ISP sees: "User browsing Cloudflare"
```

**The Kenya Rule**: Everything runs on 0026lt;10MB RAM, works on solar-powered devices.

## L1: Self-Sovereign Identity

No platform can revoke your identity.

```janus
-- Create identity
let id = identity.create()

-- Compromised? Rotate.
let (new_id, old_id) = identity.rotate(id)

-- Targeted? Burn.
let proof = identity.burn(id)
```

Ed25519 keys. Encrypted at rest. Rotatable with chain-of-custody. Burnable with cryptographic proof.

## What Makes This Different

| Traditional | Libertaria |
|-------------|------------|
| Cloud hosting | Edge/P2P infrastructure |
| Centralized auth | Cryptographic identity |
| Token governance | Reputation-based consensus |
| VC-funded | Revenue from usage |

## The Test

If the founders disappear, does your system still work?

- **Yes** = You have a submarine
- **No** = You have a glass boat

Most "sovereign" projects fail this test.
