# Libertaria Genesis Codex V3.0.0

### _The Sovereign Shell Architecture_

**Version:** 3.0.0  
**Status:** SPECIFICATION COMPLETE  
**Supersedes:** V2.4.0 (Unified)

## I. Executive Summary

V3.0 defines **The Sovereign Shell**. It strictly separates the *Internal Sovereign* (L0-L3) from the *External Network* (L4-L5).

A Chapter is fully functional and sovereign at L3. It does not need a Federation (L4) to exist. It joins a Federation only for advantage.

| Layer | Domain | RFC Range | Mandate | Description |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **L0** | **TRANSPORT** | RFC-00xx | **MANDATORY** | **The Wire.** Echo Lattice (LWF, UTCP, OPQ). Packets move without permission. |
| **L1** | **IDENTITY** | RFC-01xx | **MANDATORY** | **The Hull.** Capsule (Submarine) Identity (Membrane, Entropy, QVL). Trust without tokens. |
| **L2** | **GOVERNANCE** | RFC-02xx | **MANDATORY*** | **The Captain.** Chapter Law (Genesis, Justice, Solidarity). Rules without rulers. |
| **L3** | **ECONOMICS** | RFC-04xx, 06xx | **OPTIONAL** | **The Engine.** Production & Value ($TBT, $SCRAP, Anchors). Value without banks. |
| **L4** | **FEDERATION** | RFC-065x-07xx | **OPTIONAL** | **The Fleet.** Inter-Chapter Polity (Treaties, Bridges, War). Scale without state. |
| **L5** | **CIVILIZATION** | RFC-08xx+ | **OPTIONAL** | **The Applications.** LatticePost, Markets, Media. Life without censors. |

*RFC-0200 is mandatory for Chapter creation; not for individual nodes.*

## II. The Architectural Logic (The V3.0 Correction)

### Why L3 (Economics) is Below L4 (Federation)

1. **Production Precedes Trade:** A community must produce value (L3) and define ownership before it can trade or ally with others (L4). Robinson Crusoe produces before he meets Friday.

2. **Sovereignty Precedes Alliance:** A Chapter is a self-contained submarine. It has an engine (Economy) inside the hull. The Fleet (Federation) is an external arrangement between submarines.

3. **Law Precedes Money:** L2 (Governance) defines the contract. L3 (Economics) executes the contract.

### The "Sovereign Unit" Test

In V3.0, a single Chapter is fully functional from L0 to L3:

- It can communicate (L0)
- It can identify members (L1)
- It can govern itself (L2)
- It can produce and track value (L3)

It needs **nothing external** to exist. This is **sovereignty**.

L4-L5 are **opt-in optimizations**, not dependencies.

## III. The Capsule vs. Payload Distinction

### The Capsule (L0-L3)

The **Sovereign Shell** = The submarine that survives without payload.

- **L0 (Transport):** The pressure hull. Keeps water out.
- **L1 (Identity):** The navigation system. Knows where it is.
- **L2 (Governance):** The command structure. Decides where to go.
- **L3 (Economics):** The engine. Moves through the water.

A submarine with empty cargo holds is still a submarine. It can surface, dive, navigate, and survive.

### The Payload (L4-L5)

**L4-L5** = Cargo carried by the submarine.

- **L4 (Federation):** Trading with other submarines. Forming convoys.
- **L5 (Civilization):** Luxuries, culture, commerce—everything that makes life worth living.

A submarine with full cargo holds is **more attractive**. But if you jettison the cargo, the submarine survives.

This is **antifragility**.

## IV. The Mandate Pattern

| Layer | Mandate | Rationale |
|:------|:--------|:----------|
| **L0-L2** | **MANDATORY** | Sovereignty requires communication, identity, and governance. Without these, there is no "self" to be sovereign. |
| **L3** | **OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED** | A Chapter can exist without economics (pure gift economy), but most will want production tracking. |
| **L4-L5** | **OPTIONAL** | Federation and Civilization are value-adds, not necessities. |

**Key Principle:**
> **You cannot be forced into L4-L5 to use L0-L3.**

This is the **Submarine Independence Guarantee**.

## V. Migration from V2.4.0

### What Changed

1. **Layer Renumbering:** L3 (Federation) → L4. L3 is now Economics.
2. **Mandate Clarification:** L0-L2 mandatory; L3-L5 optional.
3. **Capsule/Payload Distinction:** Explicit separation of Sovereign Shell from Civilization Cargo.
4. **RFC Renumbering:** All RFCs updated to match new layer structure.

### What Stayed

- The **Orthogonal Stack** philosophy
- The **Trust Without Tokens** foundation
- The **Exit Rights** guarantee
- The **No Native Token** principle

## VI. Covenant

This Codex is a **living document**. It will evolve as we learn.

But these principles are **immutable**:

1. **Sovereignty before Scale**
2. **Exit before Voice**
3. **Protocol before Platform**
4. **Physics before Politics**

**We do not build utopia. We build exits.**

The Protocol ensures the game cannot be rigged. Physics picks the winners.
