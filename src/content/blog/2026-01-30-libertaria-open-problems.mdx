# Libertaria Open Problems

**Status:** ACTIVE RESEARCH  
**Purpose:** Community discussion forum for unresolved architectural challenges

---

> **These are not bugs. These are uncharted waters.**
> **We document unknowns so the community can navigate them together.**

---

## 1. $STASIS BOND STORAGE ALGORITHMS (UNSPECIFIED)

**Problem:** RFC-0620 ($STASIS Bond Schema) and RFC-0850 (Archive Negotiation Protocol) both reference storage algorithms and proof mechanisms, but **no canonical set of approved algorithms** has been defined at the protocol level.

### Current State

**RFC-0620 mentions:**
- Storage proof mechanisms (implied)
- Thermodynamic cost anchoring
- Bond slashing on data loss

**RFC-0850 specifies:**
```rust
enum StorageProofType {
    MerkleInclusion { root, path, leaf_index },
    ProofOfRetrievability { challenge, response },
    AnchorProof { chain, tx_id, block_height, merkle_proof },
    MultiArchiveAttestation { attesters, signatures },
}
```

But **no specification** exists for:
- Minimum acceptable proof-of-retrievability algorithms (PoR)
- Challenge/response protocols (frequency, complexity, validation)
- Merkle tree construction standards (hash function, balancing, depth limits)
- Acceptable anchor chain standards (Bitcoin only? Kaspa? Chapter chains?)

### Open Questions

| Question | Impact | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| What PoR algorithms are protocol-approved? | Archive Node interoperability | HIGH |
| What is the minimum challenge frequency? | Security vs. operational cost | HIGH |
| Can Archives use custom proof schemes? | Flexibility vs. standardization | MEDIUM |
| What happens if proof schemes are deprecated? | Long-term storage guarantees | HIGH |
| Should there be a "proof difficulty" standard? | Prevent weak Archives | HIGH |

## 2. REPUTATION ORACLE CONSENSUS (UNDEFINED)

**Problem:** RFC-0120 (Quasar Vector Lattice) describes reputation as "emergent from attestations," but does not specify:
- How conflicting attestations are resolved
- The threshold for "sufficient reputation"
- Sybil resistance in reputation bootstrapping
- The decay function for stale attestations

### Current State

The QVL is described as "ambient," but **computationally undefined**.

### Open Questions

- Is reputation global, Chapter-specific, or context-dependent?
- How do we prevent "reputation inflation" (mutual back-scratching)?
- What is the "right to be forgotten" in a permanent ledger?
- How do negative attestations (slashings) propagate?

---

## 3. CHAPTER MERGE/FORK PROTOCOLS (INCOMPLETE)

**Problem:** RFC-0200 (Chapter Genesis) specifies creation and exit, but not:
- How Chapters merge (federation expansion)
- How Chapters split amicably (fork without feud)
- Asset/reputation portability across merges
- Dispute resolution when forks disagree on history

### Context

The "right to fork" is sacred. But **forking without protocol** leads to Balkanization.

### Open Questions

- Should merged Chapters retain separate L2 governance?
- How do we prevent "fork spam" (malicious Chapter fragmentation)?
- What is the "genesis block" of a forked Chapter?
- Can a Chapter "un-merge" later?

## Call for Contributions

These problems require **community wisdom**. The Core Team will not dictate solutions.

**To propose a solution:**
1. Write an RFC draft
2. Post to the technical forum
3. Tag with `#open-problem-{number}`
4. Await peer review

**The best solutions will be canonized.** The rest will be documented as "considered alternatives."

*These are not obstacles. These are invitations to build.*
