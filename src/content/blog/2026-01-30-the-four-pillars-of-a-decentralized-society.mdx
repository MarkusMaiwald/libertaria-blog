# The Four Pillars of a Decentralized Society

**Author:** Markus Maiwald
**Original:** October 2017

## The Foundation

Libertaria produces technologies. Individually, these technologies are useful. Combined, they enable something different: the infrastructure for a fully decentralized life.

This is not escapism. This is not off-grid survivalism in a digital treehouse. This is the construction of sovereign, federated, resilient communities—operating beyond the reach of centralized control while maintaining everything recognizable as civilization.

We build interconnected communities following shared protocols and core values. Within these boundaries, each community—each Chapter—remains free to adopt its own charter, its own political approach, its own economic model. The protocol enforces interoperability. The Chapter enforces its constitution.

We do not petition for legitimacy. We build the exit.


## The Structural Necessities

There are many ways to analyze what a society requires. We work from four pillars—not options, but structural necessities. Each provides a vital function. Any can be constructed independently. But if any one is missing, the entire structure becomes unstable.

A society requires:

1. **Communication** — The ability to exchange ideas and determine whether cooperation is desired
2. **Law** — The framework for defining terms of cooperation and resolving disputes
3. **Production** — The capacity to create what cooperation demands
4. **Finance** — The mechanism to transact goods and services, rewarding contribution

This holds whether the society is centralized or decentralized. The difference: in a decentralized society, **all four pillars must be decentralized**. A single centralized pillar becomes the capture point for the entire structure.


## Decentralized Communication

Before any cooperation, there must be communication. In a decentralized society, this communication must be private and must not traverse centralized intermediaries.

**Requirements:**

- A truly decentralized network—peer-to-peer, without ISPs as chokepoints, without centralized data aggregation
- Strong cryptography ensuring communications remain visible only to intended recipients

These problems are largely solved. The technologies exist and function. What remains is efficiency gains and adoption. The infrastructure already supports decentralized messaging and can extend to almost any application.

Communication without permission. This pillar stands.


## Decentralized Law

Once we can communicate freely and wish to cooperate, we require common standards for forming agreements. We require mechanisms to enforce these agreements when parties disagree.

The current focus in crypto is smart contracts—automated agreement execution. This addresses the least interesting problem. Automating contract fulfillment is an engineering achievement. The difficult question: **what happens when things go wrong?**

If one party claims breach, cryptocurrency held in escrow can theoretically transfer. But what if parties disagree about whether breach occurred? What if they disagree about what the contract stipulates?

"Write better contracts" is not an answer. Flawlessly encoding agreements in code exceeds the capability of most people—including most developers, given the catastrophic bugs in deployed smart contracts. If most people cannot use a system, the system has failed, not the users. Current smart-contract platforms serve large corporations with automatable processes and resources to pay escalating fees. They do not serve ordinary people.

Ordinary people have complex needs. They make mistakes. They change their minds. Arbitration systems remain necessary—and arbitration is difficult to decentralize.

**The approach:**

- Choice of adjudicator
- Choice of enforcer
- Choice among multiple legal frameworks

This sounds radical only because centralization has erased memory. These mechanisms operated before the invention of the nation-state. Smaller communities make these approaches viable again—now enhanced through technology.

Law without monopoly. This pillar requires construction.


## Decentralized Production

Centralized production and logistics transformed the world—in many ways for the better. But billions remain ill-served: forced into early supply-chain links for minimal compensation, or excluded from the system entirely.

Decentralized production provides alternatives. It circumvents extractive tariffs. It generates wealth where needed, when needed, without third-party extraction.

**Two domains require decentralization:**

1. **Materials and processes** — The inputs and methods for creating goods
2. **Energy** — The power driving these processes

Decentralized production means closed resource cycles: materials reused and recycled locally. Profit and management of resources distributed rather than concentrated.

The trajectory: from single corporations controlling vast underpaid workforces toward smaller systems where people produce goods, grow food, and provide services from sovereign positions. Co-working spaces. Co-producing firms. Geographically contained supply chains that encourage efficiency and reduce waste.

The critical outputs for a fully decentralized society: food, shelter materials, clothing. Knowledge for producing these must remain in the commons. Low-cost tools and solutions must be accessible.

Production without dependency. This pillar advances.


## Decentralized Finance

Finally: the ability to transact freely without intermediaries, including banks. The financial system is a network of contracts. People are actors; transactions are agreements.

Given humanity's relationship with money, this pillar has received the most attention. The technologies are widespread and proven. The scaling problems are real but solvable.

Bitcoin handles roughly ten transactions per second. Workarounds remain temporary. Some efficiency sacrifice is inherent to decentralization—but a global transaction network must handle global demand. Otherwise only those who can afford transaction fees participate, and we return to the original problem: those with fewer resources excluded from the system.

Smaller federated communities provide the key. Local transactions stay local. Global settlement occurs only when necessary. The security of a global network with the efficiency of local processing.

Finance without gatekeepers. This pillar functions.


## The Binding Requirements

The four pillars are necessary but not sufficient. Two additional requirements bind them into a functional whole:

**Trustless Identity and Reputation**

Without decentralized identity, every interaction requires either blind trust or centralized verification. Without decentralized reputation, there is no accumulated social capital—no way to distinguish reliable actors from predators without appealing to central authority.

**Decentralized Governance**

Communities must make collective decisions. They must resolve internal conflicts. They must adapt to changing conditions. Without decentralized governance mechanisms, communities either fragment or recentralize around whoever accumulates enough power to impose decisions.

These problems are harder than the four pillars. They require experimentation across multiple communities—different approaches tested against different conditions.

Smaller communities enable this experimentation. Results can be observed without jeopardizing the entire network. What works propagates. What fails remains contained.

Remove any pillar, the structure destabilizes.
Remove the binding layers, the pillars cannot coordinate.

This is not a vision document. This is an engineering specification for civilizational exit.


## The Position

We do not ask permission to build this.

We do not seek validation from the systems we are exiting.

We do not promise utopia—we provide infrastructure. What communities build with that infrastructure is their sovereignty.

The centralized world will not reform itself. The incentives point toward greater extraction, greater surveillance, greater control. Those who benefit from centralization will not voluntarily dismantle it.

**We build the alternative.**

The technologies exist or are under construction. The communities exist or are forming. The protocol exists or is being specified.

What remains is assembly.


*"We do not build platforms. We build exits."*

The four pillars are timeless. The implementations evolve.
