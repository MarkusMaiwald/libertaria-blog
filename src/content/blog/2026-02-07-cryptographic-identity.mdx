# Cryptographic Identity vs. Platform Accounts

Your Twitter account is not your identity.

Your Google account is not your identity.

Your Ethereum address is not your identity.

**Your keys are your identity.** Everything else is borrowed.

---

## The Platform Trap

| Platform | Can Revoke You? | Can Censor You? |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Twitter/X | Yes | Yes |
| Google | Yes | Yes |
| GitHub | Yes | Yes |
| Discord | Yes | Yes |
| Ethereum (validators) | No* | Yes (censorship possible) |

*They can't revoke your keys, but they can censor transactions.

## Platform Identity Flow

```
You → Email/Phone → Platform → Identity
              ↑
         Platform controls this
```

Break the link above you, and you're nobody.

## Cryptographic Identity Flow

```
You → Keys → Cryptographic Proof → Identity
        ↑
   You control this
```

No platform. No gatekeeper. Just math.

## Ed25519: The Gold Standard

Libertaria uses Ed25519:

```janus
-- Create identity
let id = identity.create()

-- Keys are yours
let public_key = id.public_key   -- Share this
let secret_key = id.secret_key   -- Never share

-- Prove ownership
let challenge = random_bytes(32)
let signature = ed25519.sign(secret_key, challenge)
let verified = ed25519.verify(public_key, challenge, signature)
-- verified == true
```

No server. No database. Just you and your keys.

## Rotation: The Superpower

What if keys are compromised?

```janus
-- Rotate to new keys
let (new_id, old_id) = identity.rotate(id)

-- Old identity invalidated
-- New identity linked by cryptographic proof
-- Chain of custody preserved
```

Platform accounts: Beg support for recovery.  
Cryptographic identity: Rotate and move on.

## Burn: The Nuclear Option

What if you're targeted?

```janus
-- Cryptographic deletion
let proof = identity.burn(id)

-- Secret key securely erased
-- Burn proof published
-- Identity demonstrably destroyed
```

No platform can "close your account." You control the existence of your identity.

## QVL: Trust Without Platforms

How do you know who to trust?

Platforms: Blue checkmarks, reviews, reputation scores.  
All controlled by the platform.

Libertaria: **QVL (Quasar Vector Lattice)**

```
Alice trusts Bob
Bob trusts Charlie
Charlie trusts David

→ Alice can verify David through trust chain
```

No central authority. Just cryptographic proof of relationships.

## The Comparison

| Feature | Platform Account | Cryptographic Identity |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Creation | Platform permission | Instant, permissionless |
| Recovery | Support tickets | Key backup or rotation |
| Portability | Locked to platform | Universal |
| Censorship | Platform decides | Mathematically impossible |
| Revocation | Platform decides | Only you can burn |
| Trust | Platform reputation | Cryptographic proof |

## The Real Test

Ask yourself:

> "If [platform] bans me tomorrow, what do I lose?"

If the answer is "everything" — you don't have an identity. You have a rental.

*Your keys. Your identity. No platform.*
