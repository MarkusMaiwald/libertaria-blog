# Libertaria Executive Digest

*For builders with 24-hour brains and infinite curiosity*

## The Problem We Solve

**Digital sovereignty doesn't exist yet.**

You don't own your identity (platforms do). You don't own your relationships (they're rented). You can't leave without losing everything (vendor lock-in). 

Libertaria builds the infrastructure where **exit is the default**, not a negotiation.

## The Stack in 5 Minutes

### L0: Transport — *Hide in Plain Sight*
**Problem:** Firewalls block VPNs. Deep packet inspection kills privacy.
**Solution:** MIMIC skins camouflage traffic as HTTPS, DNS, or QUIC. Looks like Netflix, works like Signal.
**Key Concept:** "Evade rather than encrypt" — if they can't identify it, they can't block it.

### L1: Identity — *Your Keys, Your Rules*
**Problem:** Usernames/passwords are surveillance tools. "Sign in with Google" means Google owns your access.
**Solution:** Self-sovereign DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) with cryptographic ownership. No platform can revoke your identity.
**Key Concept:** SoulKey — deterministic key derivation. One seed, infinite identities.

### L2: Session — *Connections That Survive*
**Problem:** Network partitions kill conversations. IP changes break sessions.
**Solution:** Resilient peer-to-peer with automatic reconnection, key rotation, and offline-first design.
**Key Concept:** Exit-first governance — you can fork any conversation without losing history.

### L3: Governance — *Fork, Don't Fight*
**Problem:** Democracy = tyranny of the majority. Corporate governance = tyranny of the shareholders.
**Solution:** Chapter-based federation. Local sovereignty with transparent protocols. If you disagree, fork — the protocol supports it.
**Key Concept:** Betrayal economics — defection is mathematically expensive, cooperation is cheap.

### L4+: SDK — *Build on Sovereign Ground*
**Problem:** Web3 promised sovereignty, delivered speculation.
**Solution:** Tools for building apps that inherit cryptographic ownership by default. No tokens. No hype. Just infrastructure.

## Why This Matters (The 30,000ft View)

**The old world:** Platforms extract rent from human connection.
**The new world:** Protocols enable connection without extraction.

We're not building a company. We're building exit infrastructure. When the cage breaks, the tools must already exist.

## Key Decisions (Why We Built It This Way)

| Decision | Alternatives | Why We Chose This |
|:---------|:-------------|:------------------|
| **Zig, not Rust** | Rust, C++, Go | Explicit memory, comptime, no hidden costs |
| **No blockchain** | Ethereum, Solana | Chains are just slow databases; we need speed |
| **Post-quantum by default** | Wait for NIST | Cryptographic resilience is table stakes |
| **Kenya Rule** | Cloud-first | Must run on $5 Raspberry Pi, offline |
| **Tiered licensing** | MIT/Apache/GPL | Protect core, enable business, spread ideas |

## The Ask

We don't need investors. We don't need hype. We need:

1. **Code reviewers** — Zig expertise welcome
2. **Protocol implementers** — Other languages, other platforms
3. **Exit strategists** — Where does sovereignty matter most?
4. **Writers** — Explain this to humans who've never thought about cryptographic identity
