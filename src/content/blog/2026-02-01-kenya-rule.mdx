# The Kenya Rule

> *"If it doesn't work on a solar-powered phone in rural Kenya, it doesn't work."*

This isn't charity. It's engineering discipline.

## Why Kenya?

- **Intermittent power** (solar/battery)
- **Limited connectivity** (2G/3G)
- **Low-end devices** (4GB RAM, 64GB storage)
- **Expensive bandwidth** (pay-per-MB)

If your protocol works here, it works **everywhere**.

## Technical Constraints

| Resource | Kenya Rule Limit | Typical "Web3" Project |
|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| RAM | < 10 MB | 4+ GB (Electron apps) |
| Storage | < 100 MB | 1+ TB (blockchain nodes) |
| Bandwidth | < 1 KB/s | Assumes fiber |
| Power | Intermittent | Always-on servers |

## What This Means in Practice

### 1. No Blockchain Bloat

Most "sovereign" systems require you to sync a 1TB+ blockchain.

**Libertaria approach**: Submarine mode.
- Anchor hashes to Bitcoin/Kaspa (optional)
- State kept locally (libmdbx, 0026lt;10MB)
- Sync only what you need (sparse Merkle trees)

### 2. Efficient Serialization

```zig
// LWF (Libertaria Wire Format)
// Binary, schema-based, zero-copy

const Message = struct {
    version: u8,
    msg_type: MessageType,
    payload: []u8,
};
```

No JSON. No Protocol Buffers. Just raw bytes.

### 3. Adaptive Protocols

```zig
// Detect bandwidth, adapt skin
if (bandwidth < 10_kb_s) {
    skin = .MIMIC_DNS;  // Low bandwidth
} else if (dpi_detected) {
    skin = .MIMIC_QUIC; // Evasion
} else {
    skin = .RAW;         // Direct
}
```

### 4. Minimal Dependencies

```
Libertaria SDK Dependencies:
- Zig standard library
- libmdbx (embedded database)
- libsodium (crypto)

Total: ~500KB binary
```

No Docker. No Kubernetes. No cloud APIs.

## Why This Matters for Sovereignty

Centralized systems rely on **infinite resources**:
- "Just spin up more AWS instances"
- "Users have 16GB RAM anyway"
- "Bandwidth is cheap"

This creates **platform lock-in**. You can't self-host because the resource requirements are absurd.

**The Kenya Rule** ensures:
- Self-hosting is trivial
- Edge deployment is possible
- Censorship resistance (hard to shut down lightweight nodes)

## Real-World Deployment

```bash
# Compile for ARM (Raspberry Pi, old phones)
zig build -Dtarget=aarch64-linux-musl

# Run on solar-powered node
./libertaria-node --config=minimal.toml

# Memory usage: 8MB
# Storage usage: 45MB
# Bandwidth: ~500 bytes/hour (heartbeat)
```

## The Anti-Pattern

Watch out for projects that claim "sovereignty" but require:
- 32GB RAM minimum
- SSD storage
- "We'll decentralize later"

These are **data centers in disguise**.

## The Test

Can you run your "sovereign" infrastructure on:
- [ ] A 2015 Android phone
- [ ] Solar power
- [ ] 2G connection
- [ ] Without cloud APIs

If not, you're building for the privileged, not the sovereign.
