# THE PROTO-DYSTOPIA: How Zamyatin's "We" Invented the Future We Fear

*For Libertaria — #culture #literature #dystopia*


> *"The future needs progress. Progress needs technology. Technology needs science."*

Before *1984*. Before *Brave New World*. Before *The Hunger Games* commodified oppression into entertainment — there was *We*.

Yevgeny Zamyatin wrote it in 1921, in the blood-soaked aftermath of the Russian Revolution. He was a committed revolutionary who had been arrested, tortured, imprisoned by the Tsars. He dreamed of liberation. Instead, he witnessed the birth of something else entirely.

And he wrote the book that killed the socialist dream.


## **The Invention of Dystopia**

Most of human history had no "future." Time was cyclical — kings came and went, but there was always a king. The apocalypse brought the *end*, not what came after.

The future required a new god: **Progress**. And progress needed its prophet — **Science**.

Zamyatin stood at the crossroads. He watched the utopian socialists dream of decentralized anarcho-communism, of technology liberating humanity from toil. He watched Marxists argue that only the State — the dictatorship of the proletariat — could deliver that dream.

*We* was his answer: **The State would not liberate. It would assimilate.**

The One State. The Green Wall separating humanity from nature. The starship *Integral* — precursor to every Borg cube, every Death Star, every machine that promised order through domination.

Zamyatin didn't just write a critique. He *invented the grammar* of dystopia: the lone individual awakening to their cage, the failed rebellion, the crushing weight of rationalized oppression.


## **The Machine Stops (But We Don't)**

Here's the uncomfortable twist: Zamyatin's critique of "scientific socialism" turned out to be true of *every* system.

The pathologies he identified — the crushing bureaucracy, the separation from nature, the transformation of humans into machine-components — didn't require a communist flag. They needed only **scale**, **efficiency**, and the promise of **optimization**.

Sound familiar?

We live in Zamyatin's world now. Not the concrete brutalism of Soviet architecture, but the hermetically sealed algorithms shaping behavior. The "fully automated dark factories" producing our comforts. The AI that doesn't need to oppress us because we're already *trained*.

Zamyatin feared the State would force us into the machine.

He didn't anticipate we'd **volunteer**.


## **The Green Wall Today**

In *We*, the Green Wall separates the citizens of One State from the wild beyond. Nature is chaos; chaos is the enemy.

Today's Green Wall is transparent. We can see the forest through our screens. We post about climate collapse while the algorithm serves us ads for sustainable water bottles. We dream of Solarpunk return-to-nature while the platform monetizes our nostalgia.

The wall isn't made of glass anymore. It's made of **attention economy**. And it's working.


## **Why Read "We" Now?**

Orwell thought *We* "not a work of the first order." He was wrong — but understandably. *1984* had the sharper political blade. *Brave New World* had better drugs and orgies.

But *We* has something else: **it captures the *seduction* of the machine.**

D-503, the protagonist, isn't tortured into compliance. He's *convinced*. The algebraic precision of One State is beautiful. The transparency is honest. The rationalization is *fair*.

Until it isn't.

That's the horror Zamyatin saw before anyone else: **Oppression doesn't arrive as boot-to-face. It arrives as optimization. As convenience. As the removal of friction.**

The Borg don't conquer. They *upgrade*.


## **The Essayist's Curse**

Zamyatin paid for his vision. *We* was the first book banned by the Soviet state. He was persecuted, exiled, died in poverty in 1937.

The Western intellectuals who could have championed him were still drunk on the socialist dream. They didn't want to hear that the utopia was a trap.

Later, they weaponized his book — not as warning, but as propaganda. *We* became the cudgel with which Cold War liberals beat the Left. "See? This is where socialism leads."

But Zamyatin wasn't a liberal. He was a revolutionary who understood that **any** system — Left, Right, Corporate, State — that promises salvation through centralization and rationalization will arrive at the same destination.

The machine doesn't care who's pulling the levers.


## **Coda: Two Futures**

Zamyatin gave us the template for dystopia. But he also — accidentally — sketched its alternative.

The wild beyond the Green Wall. The irrational. The unoptimized. The *human*.

Not as political program. As **refusal**.

The dystopian hero doesn't win by taking control of the machine. They win — when they win — by **stepping outside**. By choosing chaos over order, even when chaos means suffering.

*We* isn't a warning about the future.

It's a question about **now**: 

How much of your life is *yours*? And how much is the efficient, rational, optimized output of a system you never chose?

The wall is transparent. You can see through it.

The question is whether you'll **climb**.
