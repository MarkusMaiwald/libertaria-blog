# The Future of AI: Ads, Tokens, and the Native Unit of Account

---

## The End of Differentiation

AI is rapidly commodifying. What was once the exclusive terrain of billion-dollar labs is now swarming with open-source contenders. Capabilities converge, models blur. What remains to distinguish one offering from another? Not much. A few UX tricks, a sprinkle of "memory," maybe a slicker interface. None of these create a moat. They are sandcastles against the tide.

And yet—the costs remain. Every token generated carries a price, however small. Multiply it across billions of daily interactions, across multimodal streams of text, audio, and video, and suddenly "free AI" looks like a trillion-dollar hallucination. There is no such thing as a free token. Someone, somewhere, always pays.

## The Advertising Temptation

The default answer is already lurking in plain sight: **ads.**

Advertising has historically solved the problem of *differential pricing*—the economic reality that the same service has vastly different value depending on context. Writing bedtime stories for children? Low-value. Debugging code for an app serving millions? High-value. A flat subscription cannot capture that spread. Ads, however, can. They price attention and intent with surgical precision.

If this logic holds, the AI economy may drift into the same Faustian bargain that defined search and social: subsidized access in exchange for monetized attention. Only this time, the integration will be deeper, more intimate. No clumsy banners or pop-ups. Instead: seamlessly generated recommendations, contextual purchases, even *parallel conversations* running alongside your assistant. A whisper in your ear that sounds like your AI—but is really the marketplace speaking.

## The Cost Spiral

The cost curve of AI is deceptive. Yes, inference per token is getting cheaper. But usage is rising even faster. Context windows expand, memories lengthen, and agents don't just answer—they reason, plan, and call tools recursively. A single user query may spawn a constellation of processes running for minutes or hours. 

Add AR glasses, ambient computing, and constant life-logging, and suddenly every user becomes a firehose of expensive context. Efficiency gains may slow, but demand is insatiable. Costs climb.

The result? Pressure. Pressure to monetize the free tier. Pressure to extract value from billions who cannot—or will not—pay. And when pressure meets capital, advertising is the inevitable release valve.

## The Native Ad Unit of AI

Google invented search ads. Facebook perfected social ads. TikTok weaponized the feed. Each medium found its *native ad unit*. AI will too. 

We don't know its exact form yet. Perhaps it will be boxed suggestions, affiliate integrations, or invisible nudges stitched into dialogue. Perhaps it will be a dual-model structure: a "user AI" answering honestly, and a separate "ad AI" inserting commercial payloads in a controlled, firewalled way. That at least maintains the fiction that your assistant "works for you."

But fiction is fragile. Once users suspect their AI is compromised—steering them to inferior products, manipulating outcomes for profit—the trust collapses. Will competition enforce reliability? Or will the hunger for revenue slowly corrupt every assistant until truth itself bends around the gravitational pull of advertising?

## The Question of the Native Unit

Beneath all this lies the deeper issue: what is the **native unit of account for AI**?

Advertising is one answer. Tokens-per-attention, subsidized by merchants. Another answer is subscription—cleaner, more transparent, but limited by user willingness to pay. 

A third is tokens themselves: microtransactions for micro-inferences, a Hydra-like multichain economy where every interaction carries its own native settlement. Libertaria foresaw this—local economies issuing their own currencies, reputation and value flowing peer-to-peer. AI could be the proving ground where such decentralized units finally gain traction.

The stakes are immense. Whoever defines the native unit of AI doesn't just solve monetization. They set the economic grammar of the next epoch.

## Conclusion: The Bargain Ahead

We stand before a familiar choice dressed in new clothes. Do we allow AI to follow the well-trodden path of advertising empires—cheap, universal, but subtly corrupting? Or do we invent a new economic substrate, one that lets users pay in ways other than money or attention? Reputation, micro-tokens, cooperative staking?

What's certain is this: billions of people will use AI daily, and the costs must be borne. The world is addicted to "free," but free is never free. Somewhere in the system, a unit of account emerges, anchoring the economy of intelligence.

The only question is whether it will belong to us—or to the ads.
